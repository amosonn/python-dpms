ABOUT
=====

This is python bindings to the DPMS X11 extension module for controlling
your monitor power savings state.

The DPMS interface lets you control the power level of your monitor
(On, Standby, Suspend, or Off).  It is a simple interface that lets
you get/set timeouts of inactivity to enter these states or you can
force it to enter any of the states.

See example.py on how to use it. This file should be sufficient on how
to use it. It first shows how to query all the different settings and
then shows how to set them.

See also 'man xset' for a program that lets you modify the DPMS state
from the command line.
